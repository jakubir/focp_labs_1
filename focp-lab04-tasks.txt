0. Familiarize yourself with:
a) the #define directive and use defined N and M in your program (values may differ): 
#define N 10
#define M 7

b) Character input/output functions getchar, putchar (*and getc, and putc)
Prototypes:
int getchar(void); // Read next character from standard input (stdin) 
int putchar(int character); // Writes a character to standard output (stdout) 

https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/getchar.html
https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/putchar.html

c) Running your program's executable from the command line and redirecting input/output:
./program.exe
./program.exe < input.txt 
./program.exe > output.txt

1. Tasks with 1D Arrays

1.1 Declare an array of N characters and fill it with values from 0 to N-1.

1.2 Read N integers from the user, store them in an array, print them in reverse order. To simplify the solution, you may use C++ streams (_cin_, _cout_).

1.3 Array for ASCII characters
Write a program counting the number of occurrences of letters a-z and
A-Z in the input stream. Uppercase and lowercase letters should NOT be
distinguished. Use getchar() function.

1.4 Finding the minimum element + selection sort
a) Declare an array of N integers and fill it with random numbers [hint: use rand()%100]
b) Find the minimum element in the array. 
c)* Swap the minimum element with the first element of the array.
d)* Sort the entire array by repeating steps b and c for the unsorted portion of the array.

1.5* Array for text, null terminator.
Write a program that copies a text file from stdin to stdout so that each line of text is written twice. Use getchar to read single characters and an array to store a single line of text. Print one copy of the line using putchar and the other using printf. You may assume that the length of a text line does not exceed 100 characters.

1.6* Find all prime numbers in the range from 2 to 200 using so called _Sieve
of Eratosthenes_: from the initial set of all numbers 2-200 remove
multiples of 2 exept 2; mark the smallest remaining number as prime and
remove all other multiples of it; continue until the square of the
processed number is bigger than 200 and mark all remaining numbers as
prime.

2. 2D Arrays

2.1 Declare a 2D array (size 10x10), fill it with multiplication table and print it.

2.2* Declare a 2D array (size MxN) and fill it according to the below patterns

0 0 0 0 0 
1 1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3 3

0 1 2 3 4
0 1 2 3 4
0 1 2 3 4
0 1 2 3 4

0 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 
0 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 
0 1 0 1 0

0 0 0 0 0 
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

2.3*
Declare a 2D array of size NxN and fill it according to the below pattern (take care of even and odd N).

 1  2  3  4  5  6 
20 21 22 23 24  7
19 32 33 34 25  8
18 31 36 35 26  9
