1. Use C malloc/free to:
a) Allocate memory for an array of n integers, where n is a value taken from the user. Initialize the array with random numbers from 0 to 999. Write the array as a memory block to a file. Deallocate memory.
b) Read the file back and create a singly-linked list with all numbers from the file, where single element type is:
struct element {
      int x;
      element *next;
};
c) display all elements from the list.
d) delete the list (free the memory).

a) Allocate memory for an array of n integers, where n is a value taken from the user. Initialize the array with random numbers from 0 to 999. Write the array as a memory block to a file. Deallocate memory.
