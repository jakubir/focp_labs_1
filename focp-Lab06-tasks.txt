Write a C program containing:

1. Structures describing (in a 2-D space):
 - point,
 - square (two points),
 - circle (point and radius).

2. Functions returning:
 - distance between two points (function parameters: two points),
 - middle point between two points (function parameters: two points),
 - area of a square (function parameter: a square),
 - square with the biggest area (function parameters: two squares),
 - area of a circle (function parameter: a circle).

The program should:
a) Create:
- an array of N = 1000 (N - defined/constant) points (random values of coordinates), 
- an array of M = 500 squares (coordinates taken from array of pointers),
- an array of P = 100 circles (centre points from taken from array of pointers, radiuses random),
b) Call all functions (from point 2) for random points/squares/circles from the arrays.
